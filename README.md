##1.OVERVIEW

Microsoft is taking a bold step into the world of filmmaking by establishing its movie studio. This decision was inspired by the success of prominent companies in creating original video content. However, Microsoft faces a significant challenge: they lack experience in the art of filmmaking. This is where my role comes inâ€”to conduct research and uncover the current trends and success factors in the movie industry.

BUSINESS UNDERSATNDING

Microsoft's desire to venture into the film industry stems from observing the achievements of major corporations in the realm of original video content. Despite this ambition, Microsoft recognizes its lack of expertise in movie production. Consequently, they have entrusted me with the task of researching the current landscape of the movie industry. Specifically, I am tasked with identifying popular film genres and the key elements contributing to their success. This research aims to provide the foundation for Microsoft's informed decision-making in the making of successful films.
